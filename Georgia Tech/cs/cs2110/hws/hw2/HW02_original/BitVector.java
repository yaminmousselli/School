/**
 * CS 2110 Summer 2017 HW2
 * Part 1 - Coding a bit vector
 *
 * @author YOUR NAME HERE
 *
 * Global rules for this file:
 * - You may not use multiplication, division or modulus in any method.
 * - You may not use more than 2 conditionals per method, and you may only use
 *   them in select methods. Conditionals are if-statements, if-else statements,
 *   or ternary expressions. The else block associated with an if-statement does
 *   not count toward this sum.
 * - You may not use looping constructs in most methods. Looping constructs
 *   include for loops, while loops and do-while loops. See below for exceptions
 * - In those methods that allow looping, you may not use more than 2 looping
 *   constructs, and they may not be nested.
 * - You may not declare any file-level variables.
 * - You may not declare any objects, other than String in select methods.
 * - You may not use switch statements.
 * - You may not use casting.
 * - You may not use the unsigned right shift operator (>>>)
 * - You may not write any helper methods, or call any other method from this
 *   file, another file, or the Java API to implement any method.
 * - You may only perform addition or subtraction with the number 1.
 *
 * Method-specific rules for this file:
 * - You may declare exactly one String variable, in toString only.
 * - Iteration may not be used in set, clear, toggle, isSet or isClear.
 * - Conditionals may not be used in set, clear, or toggle.
