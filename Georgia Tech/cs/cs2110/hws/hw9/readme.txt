About: BrickBreakerGBA is a game in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by a deflecting ball, controlled with a paddle, and causes collision to destroy the bricks. The paddle moves horizontally and is controlled by the arrow keys. In order for the game to start, the user must release the ball from the paddle. Next, the user must keep bouncing the ball off the paddle every time the ball is on its way down. The game ends when the player fails to keep the ball off the ground, or when the player wins.
