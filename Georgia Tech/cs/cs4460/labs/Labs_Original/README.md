# CS 4460 Labs


In-class labs for this course are designed to teach you the skills needed to create data visualizations on the web. This lab will help you to learn how to program with the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) toolkit. D3 has become the go-to tool for creating interactive visualizations. D3 leverages existing web technologies in order to bring your interactive visualizations to a global audience via the Web.

[Lab Instructions can be found on this repository's Wiki](https://github.gatech.edu/CS4460-Spring2018/Labs/wiki)

### Lab Schedule
Labs will typically be held on Fridays every week. However, there are a couple times this semester where Labs will be held on a Monday or Wednesday.

### What you should bring to labs
The labs are meant to be a hands-on learning opportunity for you. You will be programming during class - this means you should **bring your laptop to class on lab day**. This is the only time during class when the laptop restriction will be lifted.

Also, please **install all prerequisites listed in the lab post**. Each lab post will include a list of *Prerequisites* for you to have installed or downloaded on your computer before coming to lab. Please do this ahead of time to maximize the amount of time you have available to work on the lab.

### Grading
The labs are a learning opportunity for you. The concepts covered in lab are essential to performing well on the programming homework assignments. Each lab will have a submission due on T-Square at the end of that class period. These will count toward your attendance grade (in combination with the pop quizzes). Your lab submissions will be evaluated based upon completing a reasonable amount of work during the 50-minute class period. Submit what you have completed before the end of class. If you do not finish the lab during class, you are strongly encouraged to complete it outside of class, in order to prepare you for the upcoming programming assignments.

### Reading Materials
The labs will generally follow Scott Murray's [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](https://doc.lagout.org/programmation/JavaScript/Interactive%20Data%20Visualization%20for%20the%20Web_%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Designing%20with%20D3%20%5BMurray%202013-04-05%5D.pdf). Please consult this free online version of the book before coming to labs. In the *Prerequisites* section of each lab we will list the accompanying chapter or section of the Murray book.
